There are no natural boundaries. Predicting (-5), (3.2), or (10^6) does not violate any rules.\nThe linear predictor \\(X\\beta\\) also lives on the real line, so the model is internally consistent.\nLinearity works not because it is convenient, but because the mathematics of the response allows it."
