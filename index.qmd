## Professional Summary

Quantitative Data Scientist with 2.5 years of experience in AML/FCC analytics, specializing in the end-to-end development and validation of rule-based and supervised/unsupervised machine-learning models for customer risk rating, customer segmentation for TMS, alert risk scoring (name screening and TMS), and anomaly/fraud detection.

Experienced across multiple banking environments, including 4 months of onsite client engagement in the UAE, with strong exposure to transaction-based behavioural feature engineering, independent research, and direct client interaction.

Well-versed in model risk management (MRM), MMS, and SR 11-7, OCC 2011-12, ECB TRIM regulatory frameworks, with a proven ability to translate analytical outputs into regulator-ready documentation and business-interpretable insights.

## Experience

### Solytics Partners — Quantitative Consultant

*2023 – Present*

**Customer Risk Rating (CRR) System**

-   Designed and developed end-to-end customer risk rating models for 50,000+ customers using hybrid rule-based and supervised machine learning frameworks.

-   Engineered demographic and **transaction-based behavioural features** and performed **variable selection** **Correlation Analysis, VIF, IV, WOE, Chi-square Test, ANOVA test**, using pandas and scikit-learn.

-   Built and tuned models including **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost**, with hyperparameter optimization using **GridSearch and Optuna**.

-   Selected final models based on **precision, recall, PR-AUC, calibration curves, and stability metrics.**

-   Implemented **SHAP-based explainability** to interpret predictions and generate regulatory-compliant rationale for customer risk scores.

**Customer Segmentation**

-   Developed unsupervised segmentation models using K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to identify behaviour-driven customer segments for TMS.

-   Determined optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, Davies–Bouldin Index, and Calinski–Harabasz Index, AIC/BIC reduction.

-   Combined statistical validation and business interpretability to finalize actionable and stable segments.

-   Built a production-ready Python segmentation pipeline for 35,000+ customers and 4.5M+ transactions, including automated data validation, preprocessing, clustering, prediction, database updates, and logging.

-   Developed interactive monitoring dashboards using Streamlit and Plotly to track segment behavior, migration, and drift.

**Alert Prioritization Risk Scoring Model (TMS)**

-   Designed alert prioritization and risk-scoring models for transaction monitoring alerts to improve investigation efficiency.

-   Engineered features combining customer risk attributes and transaction-level risk indicators.

-   Optimized model performance using GridSearch and Optuna to balance recall–precision trade-offs.

-   Integrated SHAP-based explanations to provide transparent, alert-level rationale for compliance analysts.

**Model Validation & Governance (SR 11-7 Aligned)**

-   Performed independent validation of customer risk rating, alert prioritization, and segmentation models in alignment with SR 11-7 model risk management guidelines.

-   Assessed conceptual soundness, including model design, feature relevance, assumptions, and weight justification. Conducted data and input validation, covering source assessment, completeness checks, and missing value treatment.

-   Evaluated model development and selection metrics, **including precision, recall, KS, IV, and WoE. Performed stability and drift analysis using PSI and CSI.**

-   Reviewed **production implementation and code**, ensuring reproducibility and control effectiveness.

-   Evaluated model interpretability using **feature importance, SHAP, LIME, PDPs, and counterfactual analysis**, and documented validation findings and monitoring recommendations.

## R&D Projects

-   **Adverse Media Screening**\
    Designed LLM prompts for adverse media screening, reducing false positives by approximately **30%** through contextual understanding

-   **Anomaly Detection Dashboard**\
    Built an AML anomaly detection framework using **Isolation Forest** and **One-Class SVM**, supported by behavioural feature engineering and **LLM-generated investigative narratives**

-   **Graph Network-Based Fraud Detection**\
    Developed graph-based AML models using network metrics and community detection to identify money laundering networks, supported by LLM-based explanations

-   **RAG-Powered CBUAE Guidelines Chatbot**\
    Built a compliance chatbot using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, vector embeddings, and Guardrails AI

-   **LLM-Based Investigation Application**\
    Developed an investigation assistant using **Gemini LLM function-calling** to dynamically extract customer, account, and transaction details
